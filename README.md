# Setup

1. Install a chromium-based browser. For example, [ungoogled-chromium for windows](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows/releases). Download the windows_x64 package and put the contents of the zip into 'drivers/browser'
2. Update chrome_path within main.py to match your chromium-based browser bianary executable. You can probably skip this step if you followed the second half of the previous one.
   1. To find a browser path, search your browser within Windows search, open the file location until you get an executable, not a link.
3. Go to the [ChromeDriver website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and install the proper chromedriver for your browser version. To find your browser version go to [chrome://settings/help](chrome://settings/help) and [look at the version number for Chromium](https://files.catbox.moe/ukxxjn.png).
   1. If you're downloading ungoogled-chromium:
   2. ![image1](https://files.catbox.moe/am62um.png)
4. Place chromedriver.exe within the drivers path, or anywhere, just make sure to update the driver_path within main.py
5. After running the script, import the cookies into grammarly.com with an extension like [cookie-editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm).
   1. I recommend downloading the Microsoft Word Grammarly addon and then logging into the account there so you don't have to deal with people logging out.

## Requirements.txt

To download python requirements send ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## dont pay

I can assure you there are more worthwhile investments for your money than a glorified keylogger. Hopefully, another privacy oriented service is able to replace this.
