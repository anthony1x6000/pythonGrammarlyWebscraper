# Setup

1. Install a chromium-based browser. For example, [ungoogled-chromium for windows](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows). If you already have a chromium-based browser installed, you can move onto the next step.
2. Update chrome_path within main.py to match your chromium-based browser bianary executable.
   1. To find a browser path, search your browser within Windows search, open the file location until you get an executable, not a link.
3. Go to the [ChromeDriver website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and install the proper chromedriver for your browser version. To find your browser version go to [chrome://settings/help](chrome://settings/help) and [look at the version number for Chromium](https://files.catbox.moe/ukxxjn.png).
4. Place chromedriver.exe within the drivers path, or anywhere, just make sure to update the driver_path within main.py
