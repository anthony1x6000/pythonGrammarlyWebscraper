# Setup

1. Install a chromium-based browser. For example, [ungoogled-chromium for windows](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows/releases). Download the windows_x64 package and put the contents of the zip into 'drivers/browser'
2. Update chrome_path within main.py to match your chromium-based browser bianary executable. You can probably skip this step if you followed the second half of the previous one.
   1. To find a browser path, search your browser within Windows search, open the file location until you get an executable, not a link.
3. Go to the [ChromeDriver website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and install the proper chromedriver for your browser version. To find your browser version go to [chrome://settings/help](chrome://settings/help) and [look at the version number for Chromium](https://files.catbox.moe/ukxxjn.png).
   1. If you're downloading ungoogled-chromium:

I can assure you there are more worthwhile investments for your money than a glorified keylogger. Hopefully, another service will be able to replace this. Maybe something built on OpenAi’s GPT-3.5... Though, OpenAI’s privacy policy for their service ChatGPT isn’t much better.
